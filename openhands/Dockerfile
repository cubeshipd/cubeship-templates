# The published image writes its API key into the page it serves, which is
# meant for a machine only you can reach: anyone who opens the domain would be
# signed in. This image changes only that, the way `agent-canvas --public`
# does: the page asks for the key instead. The build fails if the entrypoint
# no longer reads the way this expects.
